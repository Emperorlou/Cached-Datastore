# Cached-Datastore
This project is a framework built on top of the regular Appengine Datastore interfaces and is used to seamlessly utilize Memcache while mimicking the native datastore interfaces. It also includes some utilities to make a variety of common tasks easier.

# Eclipse installation
I use the GWT plugin for Eclipse Juno and it installs the Appengine SDK for you as well so I recommend it.

It may complain that there is no Appengine SDK defined. Usually that just means you have to remove the Appengine SDK and re-add it (silly eclipse). 


My appologies in advance for the lack of a proper build process and manager!
